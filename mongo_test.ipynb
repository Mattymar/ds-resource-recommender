      "Chapter 10\n",
      "Sequence Modeling: Recurrent\n",
      "and Recursive Nets\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks or RNNs (Rumelhart et al., 1986a) are a family of\n",
      "neural networks for processing sequential data. Much as a convolutional network\n",
      "is a neural network that is specialized for processing a grid of values X such as\n",
      "an image, a recurrent neural network is a neural network that is specialized for\n",
      "processing a sequence of values x(1), . . . , x(τ) . Just as convolutional networks\n",
      "can readily scale to images with large width and height, and some convolutional\n",
      "networks can process images of variable size, recurrent networks can scale to much\n",
      "longer sequences than would be practical for networks without sequence-based\n",
      "specialization. Most recurrent networks can also process sequences of variable\n",
      "length.\n",
      "To go from multi-layer networks to recurrent networks, we need to take advantage\n",
      "of one of the early ideas found in machine learning and statistical models of\n",
      "the 1980s: sharing parameters across different parts of a model. Parameter sharing\n",
      "makes it possible to extend and apply the model to examples of different forms\n",
      "(different lengths, here) and generalize across them. If we had separate parameters\n",
      "for each value of the time index, we could not generalize to sequence lengths not\n",
      "seen during training, nor share statistical strength across different sequence lengths\n",
      "and across different positions in time. Such sharing is particularly important when\n",
      "a specific piece of information can occur at multiple positions within the sequence.\n",
      "For example, consider the two sentences “I went to Nepal in 2009” and “In 2009,\n",
      "I went to Nepal.” If we ask a machine learning model to read each sentence and\n",
      "extract the year in which the narrator went to Nepal, we would like it to recognize\n",
      "the year 2009 as the relevant piece of information, whether it appears in the sixth\n",
      "373\n",
      "CHAPTER 10. SEQUENCE MODELING: RECURRENT AND RECURSIVE NETS\n",
      "word or the second word of the sentence. Suppose that we trained a feedforward\n",
      "network that processes sentences of fixed length. A traditional fully connected\n",
      "feedforward network would have separate parameters for each input feature, so it\n",
      "would need to learn all of the rules of the language separately at each position in\n",
      "the sentence. By comparison, a recurrent neural network shares the same weights\n",
      "across several time steps.\n",
      "A related idea is the use of convolution across a 1-D temporal sequence. This\n",
      "convolutional approach is the basis for time-delay neural networks (Lang and\n",
      "Hinton 1988 , ; Waibel et al., 1989; Lang et al., 1990). The convolution operation\n",
      "allows a network to share parameters across time, but is shallow. The output\n",
      "of convolution is a sequence where each member of the output is a function of\n",
      "a small number of neighboring members of the input. The idea of parameter\n",
      "sharing manifests in the application of the same convolution kernel at each time\n",
      "step. Recurrent networks share parameters in a different way. Each member of the\n",
      "output is a function of the previous members of the output. Each member of the\n",
      "output is produced using the same update rule applied to the previous outputs.\n",
      "This recurrent formulation results in the sharing of parameters through a very\n",
      "deep computational graph.\n",
      "For the simplicity of exposition, we refer to RNNs as operating on a sequence\n",
      "that contains vectors x(t) with the time step index t ranging from 1 to τ . In\n",
      "practice, recurrent networks usually operate on minibatches of such sequences,\n",
      "with a different sequence length τ for each member of the minibatch. We have\n",
      "omitted the minibatch indices to simplify notation. Moreover, the time step index\n",
      "need not literally refer to the passage of time in the real world, but only to the\n",
      "position in the sequence. RNNs may also be applied in two dimensions across\n",

      "The explicit memory approach is illustrated in Fig. 10.18, where we see that\n",
      "a “task neural network” is coupled with a memory. Although that task neural\n",
      "network could be feedforward or recurrent, the overall system is a recurrent network.\n",
      "The task network can choose to read from or write to specific memory addresses.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to the second article in a multi-part series about the design and\n",
      "architecture of scalable software and big data solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we’ll focus on various architectural patterns and styles.\n",
      "We’ll also briefly cover network communication and information transfer\n",
      "concepts, as well as define and explain SDKs and APIs as related to some of\n",
      "the architectures discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Architectural Patterns and Design Patterns Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuse is critical in software development. Reinventing the wheel is\n",
      "unnecessary, time-consuming, doesn’t follow best practices, and is ultimately\n",
      "very expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, software architects and engineers embrace _patterns_ to apply the\n",
      "same, or very similar solutions to commonly occurring problems. _Design\n",
      "patterns_ refer to reusable patterns applied in software code, whereas\n",
      "_architectural patterns_ are reusable patterns used to design complete\n",
      "software, big data, IoT, and/or analytics-based solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design patterns are usually categorized as either _creational_, _structural_,\n",
      "_behavioral_, or _concurrent_, and there are many well-defined patterns for\n",
      "each category. We will focus primarily on architectural patterns in this\n",
      "article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Architectural patterns, on the other hand, are often categorized and grouped\n",
      "by an _architectural style_. Wikipedia lists the following architectural\n",
      "styles: _structure_, _shared memory_, _messaging_, _adaptive systems_, and\n",
      "_distributed systems_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first article of this series noted that typical cloud solutions consist of\n",
      "clients, servers, and data storage. Servers usually host databases, web\n",
      "servers, services, microservices, and so on. Clients typically include\n",
      "desktop, web, and/or native mobile applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Network Communication and Information Transfer\n",
      "\n",
      "Before diving deeper into specific patterns, let’s briefly discuss how\n",
      "information is transferred between different computers, software, and\n",
      "services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, everything transmitted on local networks and _the Internet_ are a\n",
      "form of data _message_ and are typically encoded according to a specific\n",
      "_protocol_. The _network protocols_ found in the _OSI model_ layers are the\n",
      "most common, and include _HTTP/HTTPS_, _TCP/IP_, _UDP_, _IPv4/IPv6_, and so\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "All requests made from a web browser to a server, and the subsequent\n",
      "responses, leverage the _HTTP_ and _TCP/IP_ protocols. Two primary _messaging\n",
      "patterns_ are _request-response_ (e.g., _HTTP_) and _one-way_ (e.g., _UDP_).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this information transfer mechanism, let’s explore various ways in which\n",
      "this applies to software architecture and related patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Client-server, Layers, and Tiers\n",
      "\n",
      "Many applications are classified as _client-server_, in which a client makes\n",
      "requests to a server responsible for providing an appropriate response. Both\n",
      "the client and the server can be considered independent applications that\n",
      "interact with each other through well-defined _interfaces_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code in both is often separated into _layers_ that each address different\n",
      "concerns. Common layers include a _presentation layer_, _application (or\n",
      "service) layer_, _business (or domain) logic layer_, and a _data access (or\n",
      "persistence) layer_. Actual data storage and databases can be considered the\n",
      "_database layer_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Layers are used to implement _separation of concerns_ in the code that’s\n",
      "running on a single computing machine. Architecturally, software solutions are\n",
      "often separated into _tiers_, where a tier describes a part of the solution\n",
      "running on a different computing instance (_physical_ or _virtual_).\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical tiers include the _presentation tier_, _domain logic tier_ (e.g.,\n",
      "_API_), and _data storage tier_. This is a typical _3-tier architecture_, and\n",
      "_n-tier_ is used to describe an architecture that includes more than one tier.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Services, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and Microservices\n",
      "\n",
      "Software applications can be separated into _services_, or units of software\n",
      "functionality that are deployed remotely and can be accessed via networking\n",
      "communication protocols. Services are leveraged for many uses, with\n",
      "information retrieval and execution of operations being the most common.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very common architectural pattern, particularly suited to _enterprise_\n",
      "and/or large-scale applications is called _service-oriented architecture_\n",
      "(_SOA_). SOA describes a solution that’s broken into discrete components that\n",
      "are each responsible for a certain part of the solution’s functionality, and\n",
      "provide that functionality as a service to other solution components.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to _Wikipedia_, an SOA service has the following four properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome\n",
      "  * It is self-contained\n",
      "  * It is a black box for its consumers\n",
      "  * It may consist of other underlying services\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "SOA is a great example of _separation of concerns_, _modularity_, and _loose\n",
      "coupling_ as applied at the application or solution level. The most typical\n",
      "implementations of SOA include _web services_, _messaging services_, and\n",
      "_RESTful services_ (e.g., _API_).\n",
      "\n",
      "A popular and more specialized version of SOA is know as _microservices_.\n",
      "Microservices are organized around individual application capabilities, as\n",
      "compared to the services of SOA being organized around a specific business\n",
      "activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microservices are very similar to the services of SOA, but are characterized\n",
      "as being:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * More granular (smaller) and finer grained interfaces\n",
      "  * More lightweight\n",
      "  * More modular and loosely coupled\n",
      "  * More easily replaced\n",
      "  * More language and technology agnostic\n",
      "  * More specialized around a specific application capability\n",
      "  * Better suited for containerization and deployment\n",
      "  * Better suited for agility and continuous delivery\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Microservices also introduce many potential drawbacks as well, which should be\n",
      "considered carefully. Some of these are related to the _fallacies of\n",
      "distributed computing_, and include:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Significant increase in:\n",
      "    * Application testing, configuration, deployment, and management complexity\n",
      "    * Internal team communications and coordination costs\n",
      "    * HTTP request/response call chain complexity\n",
      "  * Potential networking issues such as network failure and high latency\n",
      "  * Computational and performance overhead due to network-based messaging communication and transfer protocols\n",
      "  * Requires DevOps adoption (e.g., scalability) and monitoring practices\n",
      "  * Potentially distributed transaction handling\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Some also note that the true benefits of microservices are not realized unless\n",
      "each microservice has sole ownership of their data, i.e., having their own\n",
      "data store.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Solution Architectures and Patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to those already described, there are many other specific\n",
      "architectural patterns that you should know about, and consider using in your\n",
      "next solution if applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a high level overview of different key patterns categorized by\n",
      "different architectural styles, including some of the Wikipedia-noted styles\n",
      "mentioned earlier. Since the scope of this article is limited, some patterns\n",
      "are simply named for reference, or discussed at a very high level. The reader\n",
      "is therefore encouraged to do additional research as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first article of this series we discussed _separation of concerns\n",
      "(SOC)_ as a way of separating different _concerns_ of a code base or complete\n",
      "solution in order to improve code reuse, reduce _coupling_, improve\n",
      "testability and maintainability, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the extreme case where concerns are barely separated, if at all, an\n",
      "application and its code base is referred to as being _monolithic_. This type\n",
      "of application has very tightly coupled and mostly non-reusable code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software solutions that embrace and emphasize _SOC_ are usually referred to as\n",
      "being _layered_ and/or _tiered_ as previously discussed, but also can be\n",
      "_component-based_, _modular_, _service oriented_, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Components_ are usually higher level, larger abstractions of encapsulated\n",
      "concerns of a complete solution. Examples include _web services_, _software\n",
      "packages_, or _software binaries_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Modules_ on the other hand are usually separate and encapsulated concerns\n",
      "within an application, service, package, or library’s code base. These items\n",
      "when composed of many interchangeable, yet integrated modules is considered to\n",
      "be highly _modular_ and therefore _loosely coupled_.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Shared memory**\n",
      "\n",
      "The main pattern to note here is the _blackboard_ pattern and associated\n",
      "_blackboard system_. The common terms involved with this pattern include\n",
      "_blackboard_, _knowledge sources_, and _control component_ (or _control\n",
      "shell_).\n",
      "\n",
      "The pattern is analogous to an actual blackboard (or whiteboard) session, in\n",
      "which multiple people (_knowledge sources_) write various approaches or\n",
      "elements to solve a problem on a _board_ (_blackboard_), and then a _control\n",
      "component_ is able to selectively piece together (i.e., execute) knowledge\n",
      "sources as needed to produce a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wikipedia notes that this pattern may have lost some popularity in favor of\n",
      "statistical-based techniques such as _Hidden Markov Models_.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Messaging**\n",
      "\n",
      "A very important architecture is called _event-driven_ or _message-driven_\n",
      "architecture (_EDA_). This architecture deals with producing, detecting,\n",
      "processing, and responding to events, which as previously mentioned, take the\n",
      "form of messages. This architectural pattern promotes loose coupling,\n",
      "scalability, high performance, efficiency, and potentially _asynchronous_,\n",
      "_non-blocking_ operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Events_ are created by a so-called _event emitter_ or _agent_, which are\n",
      "received by _event consumers_ or _sinks_. The communication and pairing\n",
      "between emitters and consumers is facilitated by _event channels_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specific event channel and event handling framework is typically\n",
      "implemented using a system or pattern such as _message-oriented middleware_\n",
      "(_MOM_), _publish-subscribe_ (_pub/sub_), and _message queues_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other related concepts and architectures are the _enterprise service bus\n",
      "(ESB)_ and _enterprise messaging system (EMS)_. An ESB acts as a highly\n",
      "flexible and loosely coupled communication system, in the form of a virtual\n",
      "software _bus_, that sits between distributed services and/or software\n",
      "applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Message-based communication via an ESB is based on an enterprise messaging\n",
      "system (EMS), which defines and outlines various standards, best practices,\n",
      "and implementations of the messaging system itself. This includes message\n",
      "formats, queuing, transfer protocols, application protocols, security, and\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Adaptive systems**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most predominant architectural patterns in this category are _plug-ins_,\n",
      "_integrations_, and the _microkernel_ pattern. Plug-ins and integrations are\n",
      "increasingly being referred to as _apps_ or _extensions_. The microkernel\n",
      "pattern is an operating system-level pattern, and is therefore not applicable\n",
      "to this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plug-ins and integrations can be considered as part of a broader category\n",
      "known as _add-ons_, which allow users to add functionality and features as\n",
      "needed. Software applications that allow and support any form of _add-ons_ are\n",
      "considered to be _customizable_. The main difference between plug-ins,\n",
      "extensions, and integrations involves the type and form of functionality being\n",
      "added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plug-ins tend to be software packages that host applications leverage (via a\n",
      "_plug-in manager_) to provide additional non-native functionality by\n",
      "specifying an interface and API for which the plug-in adapts to. Plug-ins tend\n",
      "to be dedicated software packages created specifically for the host\n",
      "application. Examples include _Salesforce Apps_ and _Adobe Flash_ for web\n",
      "browsers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrations, on the other hand, are ‘apps’ that can extend a host\n",
      "application’s functionality like a plug-in, but typically represent a stand\n",
      "alone software application or service that exists as a product or service in\n",
      "its own right. In this case, the host recognizes another app or service’s\n",
      "usefulness and identifies ways in which it can be integrated into a user’s\n",
      "workflow within the host application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples include _Google Calendar_, _Trello_, and _Jira_ integrations with\n",
      "_Slack_. _Google Chrome_ offers many app integrations and extensions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Distributed systems**\n",
      "\n",
      "_Distributed_ systems use more than one physical or virtual compute instance\n",
      "to provide functionality, e.g., a software application, service, or database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some examples include the _tiered_ and _service-oriented_ architectures, as\n",
      "discussed. Other notable architectures in this category include _peer-to-\n",
      "peer_, _space-based_, and the many different architectural patterns associated\n",
      "with _cloud computing_ and _cloud services_ (e.g., _AWS_) in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peer-to-peer computing contrasts with client-server computing in that peers\n",
      "(aka _nodes_) work together to accomplish tasks and share resources, as\n",
      "opposed to being characterized by strict separations of _consumer/provider_ or\n",
      "_request/response_ relationships. Peers can be both consumers and providers\n",
      "within their network.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Space-based_ architecture is a pattern driven primarily by scalability and\n",
      "performance goals, particularly when involving large numbers of concurrent and\n",
      "often unpredictable loads on the system, usually in the form of requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pattern is a bit complex relative to some others, and involves\n",
      "horizontally scalable computing or _processing_ units that each leverage _in-\n",
      "memory data_ for maximum performance. There are also caching and asynchronous\n",
      "data persistence components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, space-based architecture involves a _virtualized middleware_\n",
      "component, which consists of a _messaging grid_, _data grid_, _processing\n",
      "grid_, and _deployment manager_. This middleware component is a _controller_\n",
      "that performs most management and coordination tasks associated with this\n",
      "architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Other Architectural Patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some other notable patterns worth looking into that aren’t discussed\n",
      "in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * _Proxy server_\n",
      "  * _Caching_\n",
      "  * _MV*__ (e.g., _MVC_, _MVP_, _MVVM_, …)\n",
      "  * _Single page application (SPA)_ vs multi-page\n",
      "  * _Static site_ (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets only)\n",
      "  * _Job Scheduler_, aka _scheduling_\n",
      "  * _Inversion of control (IOC)_  \n",
      "\n",
      "## APIs and SDKs\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important and widely used patterns is the _application\n",
      "programming interface_ (_API_) and often complementary _software development\n",
      "kit_ (_SDK_).\n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed, web applications are usually split between client and server\n",
      "components, where the client typically runs in a web browser or mobile device,\n",
      "and the server typically runs on a physical or virtual machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very popular and widespread trend is to shift an increasing amount of\n",
      "application logic to the front-end of web and/or native mobile-based\n",
      "applications. Given this, many software applications communicate primarily\n",
      "through matched SDKs on the client, and _RESTful_ APIs on the server.\n",
      "\n",
      "_REST_ stands for _representational state transfer_ and is a communication and\n",
      "information transfer pattern between clients and servers. Servers expose\n",
      "_RESTful_ API _endpoints_ so that client applications can communicate with\n",
      "them over common Internet protocols (e.g., _HTTP_ and _HTTPS_), and in order\n",
      "to perform _CRUD_ operations on application data, or to execute specific\n",
      "server-side tasks and operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "SDKs are packages that client applications (web and mobile) can use to\n",
      "interact with related APIs, and are designed to simplify and abstract away\n",
      "much of the complexity of the client/server communication and data transfer.\n",
      "SDKs are usually implemented as JavaScript libraries or packages for web\n",
      "applications, and also often come in native mobile (_iOS_ and _Android_)\n",
      "versions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",

      "While these, and other disciplines and areas of expertise (not shown here),\n",
      "are all characteristics of the data scientist role, I like to think of a data\n",
      "scientist’s foundation as being based on four pillars. Other more specific\n",
      "areas of expertise can be derived from these pillars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss them now.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Pillars of Data Science Expertise\n",
      "\n",
      "While data scientists often come from many different educational and work\n",
      "experience backgrounds, most should be strong in, or in an ideal case be\n",
      "experts in four fundamental areas. In no particular order of priority or\n",
      "importance, these are:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Business domain\n",
      "  * Statistics and probability\n",
      "  * Computer science and software programming\n",
      "  * Written and verbal communication\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "There are other skills and expertise that are highly desirable as well, but\n",
      "these are the primary four in my opinion. These will be referred to as the\n",
      "data scientist _pillars_ for the rest of this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, people are often strong in one or two of these pillars, but\n",
      "usually not equally strong in all four. If you do happen to meet a data\n",
      "scientist that is truly an expert in all, then you’ve essentially found\n",
      "yourself a _unicorn_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these pillars, a data scientist is a person who should be able to\n",
      "leverage existing data sources, and create new ones as needed in order to\n",
      "extract meaningful information and actionable insights. These insights can be\n",
      "used to drive business decisions and changes intended to achieve business\n",
      "goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is done through business domain expertise, effective communication and\n",
      "results interpretation, and utilization of any and all relevant statistical\n",
      "techniques, programming languages, software packages and libraries, data\n",
      "infrastructure, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Science Venn Diagrams\n",
      "\n",
      "One can find many different versions of the data scientist _Venn diagram_ to\n",
      "help visualize these pillars (or variations) and their relationships with one\n",
      "another. David Taylor wrote an excellent article on these Venn diagrams\n",
      "entitled, _Battle of the Data Science Venn Diagrams_. I highly recommend\n",
      "reading it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is one of my favorite data scientist Venn diagrams created by Stephan\n",
      "Kolassa. You’ll notice that the primary ellipses in the diagram are very\n",
      "similar to the pillars given above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Stephan Kolassa\n",
      "\n",
      "This diagram, and others like it, attempt to assign labels and/or characterize\n",
      "the person or field that lies at the intersection of each of the primary\n",
      "competencies shown, which I’m calling pillars here.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this diagram shows, Stephan Kolassa labels ‘The Perfect Data Scientist’ as\n",
      "the individual who is equally strong in business, programming, statistics, and\n",
      "communication. I agree completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Science Goals and Deliverables\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to understand the importance of these pillars, one must first\n",
      "understand the typical goals and deliverables associated with data science\n",
      "initiatives, and also the data science process itself. Let’s first discuss\n",
      "some common data science goals and deliverables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a short list of common data science deliverables:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Prediction (predict a value based on inputs)\n",
      "  * Classification (e.g., spam or not spam)\n",
      "  * Recommendations (e.g., Amazon and Netflix recommendations)\n",
      "  * Pattern detection and grouping (e.g., classification without known classes)\n",
      "  * Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)\n",
      "  * Recognition (image, text, audio, video, facial, …)\n",
      "  * Actionable insights (via dashboards, reports, visualizations, …)\n",
      "  * Automated processes and decision-making (e.g., credit card approval)\n",
      "  * Scoring and ranking (e.g., FICO score)\n",
      "  * Segmentation (e.g., demographic-based marketing)\n",
      "  * Optimization (e.g., risk management)\n",
      "  * Forecasts (e.g., sales and revenue)\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Each of these is intended to address a specific goal and/or solve a specific\n",
      "problem. The real question is which goal, and whose goal is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a data scientist may think that her goal is to create a high\n",
      "performing prediction engine. The business that plans to utilize the\n",
      "prediction engine, on the other hand, may have the goal of increasing revenue,\n",
      "which can be achieved by using this prediction engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this may appear to not be an issue at first glance, in reality the\n",
      "situation described is why the first pillar (business domain expertise) is so\n",
      "critical. Often members of upper management have business-centric educational\n",
      "backgrounds, such as an MBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many executives are exceptionally smart individuals, they may not be\n",
      "well versed on all the tools, techniques, and algorithms available to a data\n",
      "scientist (e.g., statistical analysis, machine learning, artificial\n",
      "intelligence, and so on). Given this, they may not be able to tell a data\n",
      "scientist what they would like as a final deliverable, or suggest the data\n",
      "sources, features (variables), and path to get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if an executive is able to determine that a specific recommendation\n",
      "engine would help increase revenue, they may not realize that there are\n",
      "probably many other ways that the company’s data can be used to increase\n",
      "revenue as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can therefore not be emphasized enough that the ideal data scientist has a\n",
      "fairly comprehensive understanding about how businesses work in general, and\n",
      "how a company’s data can be used to achieve top-level business goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "With significant business domain expertise, a data scientist should be able to\n",
      "regularly discover and propose new data initiatives to help the business\n",
      "achieve its goals and maximize their KPIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Data Science Process\n",
      "\n",
      "The data science process can be a bit variable depending on the project goals\n",
      "and approach taken, but generally mimics the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data science process involves these phases, more or less:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Data acquisition, collection, and storage\n",
      "  * Discovery and goal identification (ask the right questions)\n",
      "  * Access, ingest, and integrate data\n",
      "  * Processing and cleaning data (munging/wrangling)\n",
      "  * Initial data investigation and exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
      "  * Choosing one or more potential models and algorithms\n",
      "  * Apply data science methods and techniques (e.g., machine learning, statistical modeling, artificial intelligence, …)\n",
      "  * Measuring and improving results (validation and tuning)\n",
      "  * Delivering, communicating, and/or presenting final results\n",
      "  * Business decisions and/or changes are made based on the results\n",
      "  * Repeat the process to solve a new problem\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Here is a diagram representing a simpler version of this process.\n",
      "\n",

      "Commons\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the process in a nutshell. So how do these pillars come into play here?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Scientist Pillars, Skills, and Education In-Depth\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already discussed the business domain and communication pillars, which\n",
      "represent business acumen and top notch communication skills. This is very\n",
      "important for the discovery and goal phase. It’s also very helpful in that\n",
      "data scientists typically have to present and communicate results to key\n",
      "stakeholders, including executives.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strong soft skills, particularly communication (written and verbal) and\n",
      "public speaking ability are key. In the phase where results are communicated\n",
      "and delivered, the magic is in the data scientist’s ability to deliver the\n",
      "results in an understandable, compelling, and insightful way, while using\n",
      "appropriate language and jargon level for her audience. In addition, results\n",
      "should always be related back to the business goals that spawned the project\n",
      "in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all of the other phases listed, data scientists must draw upon strong\n",
      "computer programming skills, as well as knowledge about statistics,\n",
      "probabilities, and mathematics in order to understand the data, choose the\n",
      "correct solution approach, implement the solution, and improve on it as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "One important thing to discuss are off-the-shelf data science platforms and\n",
      "APIs. One may be tempted to think that these can be used relatively easily and\n",
      "thus not require significant expertise in certain fields, and therefore not\n",
      "require a strong, well-rounded data scientist.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s true that many of these off-the-shelf products can be used relatively\n",
      "easily, and one can probably obtain pretty decent results depending on the\n",
      "problem being solved, but there are many aspects of data science where\n",
      "experience and chops are critically important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these include having the ability to:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Customize the approach and solution to the specific problem at hand in order to maximize results, including the ability to write new algorithms and/or significantly modify the existing ones, as needed\n",
      "  * Access and query many different databases and data sources (_RDBMS_, _NoSQL_, _NewSQL_), as well as integrate the data into an analytics-driven data source (e.g., _OLAP_, _warehouse_, _data lake_, …)\n",
      "  * Find and choose the optimal data sources and data _features_ (variables), including creating new ones as needed (_feature engineering_)\n",
      "  * Understand all statistical, programming, and library/package options available, and select the best\n",
      "  * Ensure data has high integrity (good data), quality (the right data), and is in optimal form and condition to guarantee accurate, reliable, and statistically significant results\n",
      "    * Avoid the issues associated with _garbage in equals garbage out_\n",
      "  * Select and implement the best tooling, algorithms, frameworks, languages, and technologies to maximize results and scale as needed\n",
      "  * Choose the correct performance metrics and apply the appropriate techniques in order to maximize performance\n",
      "  * Discover ways to leverage the data to achieve business goals without guidance and/or deliverables being dictated from the top down, i.e., the data scientist as the idea person\n",
      "  * Work cross-functionally, effectively, and in collaboration with all company departments and groups\n",
      "  * Distinguish good from bad results, and thus mitigate the potential risks and financial losses that can come from erroneous conclusions and subsequent decisions\n",
      "  * Understand product (or service) customers and/or users, and create ideas and solutions with them in mind\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Education-wise, there is no single path to becoming a data scientist. Many\n",
      "universities have created data science and analytics-specific programs, mostly\n",
      "at the master’s degree level. Some universities and other organizations also\n",
      "offer certification programs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to traditional degree and certification programs, there are\n",
      "_bootcamps_ being offered that range from a few days or months to complete,\n",
      "online self-guided learning and MOOC courses focused on data science and\n",
      "related fields, and self-driven hands-on learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter what path is taken to learn, data scientist’s should have advanced\n",
      "quantitative knowledge and highly technical skills, primarily in statistics,\n",
      "mathematics, and computer science.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The “Science” in Data Science\n",
      "\n",
      "The term science is usually synonymous with the _scientific method_, and some\n",
      "of you may have noticed that the process outlined above is very similar to the\n",
      "process characterized by the expression, _scientific method_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an image that visualizes the scientific method as an ongoing process.\n",
      "\n",
      "By ArchonMagnus (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0\n",
      "(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, both traditional scientists and data scientists ask\n",
      "questions and/or define a problem, collect and leverage data to come up with\n",
      "answers or solutions, test the solution to see if the problem is solved, and\n",
      "iterate as needed to improve on, or finalize the solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Scientists vs. Data Analysts vs. Data Engineers\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, often the data scientist role is confused with other similar\n",
      "roles. The two main ones are _data analysts_ and _data engineers_, both quite\n",
      "different from each other, and from data science as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s explore both of these roles in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Analyst**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data analysts share many of the same skills and responsibilities as a data\n",
      "scientist, and sometimes have a similar educational background as well. Some\n",
      "of these shared skills include the ability to:\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Access and query (e.g., SQL) different data sources\n",
      "  * Process and clean data\n",
      "  * Summarize data\n",
      "  * Understand and use some statistics and mathematical techniques\n",
      "  * Prepare data visualizations and reports\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Some of the key differences however, are that data analysts typically are not\n",
      "computer programmers, nor responsible for statistical modeling, machine\n",
      "learning, and many of the other steps outlined in the data science process\n",
      "above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tools used are usually different as well. Data analysts often use tools\n",
      "for analysis and business intelligence like _Microsoft Excel_ (visualization,\n",
      "pivot tables, …), _Tableau_, _SAS_, _SAP_, and _Qlik_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts sometimes perform data mining and modeling tasks, but tend to use\n",
      "visual platforms such as _IBM SPSS Modeler_, _Rapid Miner_, _SAS_, and\n",
      "_KNIME_. Data scientists, on the other hand, perform these same tasks usually\n",
      "with tools such as _R_ and _Python_, combined with relevant libraries for the\n",
      "language(s) being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, data analysts tend to differ significantly in their interactions with\n",
      "top business managers and executives. Data analysts are often given questions\n",
      "and goals from the top down, perform the analysis, and then report their\n",
      "findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data scientists however, tend to generate the questions themselves, driven by\n",
      "knowing which business goals are most important and how the data can be used\n",
      "to achieve certain goals. In addition, data scientists typically employ much\n",
      "more advanced statistical and modeling techniques, data visualizations, and\n",
      "emphasize reporting in a more business-driven storytelling way.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Engineer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data engineers are becoming more important in the age of _big data_, and can\n",
      "be thought of as a type of _data architect_. They are less concerned with\n",
      "statistics, analytics, and modeling as their data scientist/analyst\n",
      "counterparts, and are much more concerned with data architecture, computing\n",
      "and data storage infrastructure, data flow, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data used by data scientists and big data applications often come from\n",
      "multiple sources, and must be extracted, moved, transformed, integrated, and\n",
      "stored (e.g., _ETL_/_ELT_) in a way that’s optimized for analytics, business\n",
      "intelligence, and modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data engineers are therefore responsible for data architecture, and for\n",
      "setting up the required infrastructure. As such, they need to be competent\n",
      "programmers with skills very similar to someone in a _DevOps_ role, and with\n",
      "strong data query writing skills as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key aspect of this role is database design (_RDBMS_, _NoSQL_, and\n",
      "_NewSQL_), data warehousing, and setting up a _data lake_. This means that\n",
      "they must be very familiar with many of the available database technologies\n",
      "and management systems, including those associated with _big data_ (e.g.,\n",
      "_Hadoop_ and _HBase_).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, data engineers also typically address non-functional infrastructure\n",
      "requirements such as scalability, reliability, durability, availability,\n",
      "backups, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll finish with an overview of some of the typical _tools_ in the _data\n",
      "scientist’s_ proverbial _toolbox_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since computer programming is a large component, data scientists must be\n",
      "proficient with programming languages such as _R_, _Python_, _SQL_, _Scala_,\n",
      "_Julia_, _Java_, and so on. Usually it’s not necessary to be an expert\n",
      "programmer in all of these, but R, Python, and SQL are definitely key, and\n",
      "others like _Scala_ for _big data_ are becoming more prominent as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For statistics, mathematics, algorithms, modeling, and data visualization,\n",
      "data scientists usually use pre-existing packages and libraries where\n",
      "possible. Some of the more popular ones include _Scikit-learn_, _e1071_,\n",
      "_Pandas_, _Numpy_, _TensorFlow_, _Matplotlib_, _D3_, _Shiny_, and _ggplot2_.\n",
      "\n",
      "For _reproducible_ research and reporting, data scientists commonly use\n",
      "notebooks and frameworks such as _Jupyter_, _iPython_, _Knitr_, and _R\n",
      "markdown_. These are very powerful in that the code and data can be delivered\n",
      "along with key results so that anyone can perform the same analysis, and build\n",
      "on it if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "More and more these days, data scientists should be able to utilize tools and\n",
      "technologies associated with _big data_ as well. The most popular examples\n",
      "include _Hadoop_, _Spark_, _Hive_, _Pig_, _Drill_, _Presto_, _Mahout_, and so\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, data scientists should know how to access and query many of the top\n",
      "_RDBMS_, _NoSQL_, and _NewSQL_ _database management systems_. Some of the most\n",
      "common are _MySQL_, _PostgreSQL_, _Redshift_, _MongoDB_, _Redis_, _Hadoop_,\n",
      "and _HBase_.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Harvard was right about data scientists. It’s an extremely important and high-\n",
      "demand role that can have significant impact on a business’ ability to achieve\n",
      "its goals, whether they are financial, operational, strategic, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Company’s collect a ton of data, and much of the time it’s neglected or\n",
